# MITxPro-Eye-Exercise
This is Eye Exercise Repo for MITxPro Bootcamp's Github Portfolio Project. This exercise is to create a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement. As the user move the mouse, the mouse events are being picked up and two eyeballs will be synchonized matching the mouse's moving direction.

# How to Run: 
When user put their mouse on the web page, click their mouse to trigger two eyes's movement. 
When user move their mouse, they will see both of eyes are following their mouse movement.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements 
I am planning to work on: 1. adding a function for user to click the web page to stop eyes moving  2. changing the style of eyes  3. adding elements to create a complate face.
